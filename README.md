# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project
This repository contains the code and resources for a project focused on Credit Card Fraud Detection. The project aims to develop and evaluate machine learning models to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.

## Overview
Credit card fraud is a critical concern for financial institutions and consumers alike. This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data. The dataset used for this project contains a collection of credit card transactions made by European cardholders.

## Project Highlights
* Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics.
* Addressed the class imbalance issue through undersampling techniques.
* Implemented various machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression and Random Forest for fraud detection.
* Evaluated model performance using key metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.
* Developed a function to determine the optimal threshold for classification based on the F1 score.
